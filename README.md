# coronaTracker
This program is used to tracks the recent corona virus cases, death an recoveries. I have scraped the data from the website and make a API. This Script is written in python3 and the library used is Selenium. This Selenium library handles the all the automation stuff like opening of browser , put request to website fill search box and scraping stuff.

For using the selenium first download the geckodriver driver which is a driver for firefox browser and chromedriver for chrome browser. I used so Firefox browser so, i have included the geckodriver in this repository so, no need to download externally.

> corona.py ---> This Program scrap the recent numbers of corona cases, death and recoveries and api is make using flask library of the python.

> table.py ---> This program will give the country wise number of active corona cases, death information
